# NeuroScribe

*Changing the world, one word at a time.*

***

As **second-generation immigrants** with parents that struggled with learning English, we understand that writing professional English is **extremely difficult**. To help people who need some help in learning English, or for people who just can't find that perfect word, we developed *NeuroScribe*. This tool uses Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow to analyze your writing for any suspected errors and also suggest replacements.
