# NeuroScribe

*Striving for educational equity, one word at a time.*

***
Despite the advancements made, education in the United States and around the world still faces an inequality in the amount of opportunities provided to students. With distance learning due to COVID-19, many people are not able to get good feedback on their writing. To address this problem, we created NeuroScribe.
NeuroScribe uses a machine learning model to analyze the inputted text, checking whether each word makes sense within the context of the sentence and giving feedback on the writing.

Made by Yixuan Qiao, Andy Li, and Rohan Bansal for BitHacks 2020.
