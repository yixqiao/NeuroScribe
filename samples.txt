I feel really tired today. I think I might gone to sleep.

There's an amazing story

Its amazing how something so small can warm your heart and change the way you see everything   Ok, I have to share something with u guys, i was talking to Jon, of course he read my journal entry and he is well... appologizing as much as he can, i dunno... we kinda talked things out... i think im just bitter cause well... everything lately sucks...   but in a cry for someone to talk to ... I called Keon, knowing he wouldnt answer and.. low and behold i was wrong... he picked up.. and he sounded happy.. and he knew who i was.. and he had to go cause he was talking to his dad long distance .. but i can call back.. in 20 minutes! .. so... YAY .. I thought he hated me.... i dunno .. i think its wrong cause he stood me up a few times.. but .. i dunno... im asking for trouble.. i know it.. but im desperate.. and he is sweet... just alittle odd at times.... well .. i know... things turn around quick dont they....  Ill get back to u...   MOOD: EXSITED!
